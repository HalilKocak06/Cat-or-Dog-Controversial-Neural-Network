# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Image Classification
This repository demonstrates the creation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification. The model is trained to distinguish between two classes: cats and dogs.

## Overview
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model particularly effective for image-related tasks. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through backpropagation, making them ideal for visual data. In this project, we build, train, and test a CNN to classify images into one of two categories: cats or dogs.

## Key Concepts:
## Convolution: The model applies filters to the input images to capture features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
## Pooling: This operation reduces the dimensionality of feature maps while retaining important information, making the model more efficient.
## Flattening and Fully Connected Layers: After the convolutional and pooling layers, the model transforms the data into a single vector and connects to fully connected layers, which allow the model to make predictions.
## Binary Classification: Since the task is to classify an image as either a cat or a dog, we use binary classification techniques.
## Dataset
The dataset used consists of two sets:

## Training set: Used to train the model, containing images of both cats and dogs.
## Test set: Used to evaluate the model’s performance after training.
The images are preprocessed and augmented (rescaling, zooming, flipping, etc.) to improve the model’s robustness and generalization.

## Model Training
The CNN model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. It is trained over 25 epochs, allowing the model to progressively improve its accuracy on the task. The training includes both accuracy and loss metrics to monitor the model’s performance during training and validation.

## Results
After training, the model achieves a validation accuracy of approximately 84%. The accuracy improves steadily across epochs as the model learns to better differentiate between the two image classes. The project also demonstrates the model's ability to make predictions on individual images (e.g., predicting whether a specific image is a cat or a dog).

## Use Cases
This CNN model can serve as a basis for more complex image classification tasks, including:

Multi-class classification (handling more than two categories).
Fine-tuning for specialized datasets (e.g., medical imaging, satellite images).
Transfer learning by leveraging pre-trained models for different tasks.
## Conclusion
This project provides a foundation for understanding and building CNN models for image classification. It showcases the power of deep learning in handling large amounts of image data and making accurate predictions based on learned features.
